# They-Are-Billions-Autosave-Script
When a swarm destroyed me after almost 2 hours and I had to start the stage again, I swore it will never happen again.

# How to run the script
1) Place the script inside "My Games" folder. The folder will be located under /User/Documents/My Games
Inside that folder you'll see a folder called "They Are Billions"

2) Run the script and use the menu. When running, the script will create a complete backup of the progress every 5 minutes.

3) You can use the script to select any of the previous backups made. The sript will automatically overwrite the existing folder with the backup.

That way you can use the script to load previous states, including previous in-stage states, that way if you were destroyed, you don't have to start the level from scratch again :)

If you found value in this humble script, don't be shy and star it :)
